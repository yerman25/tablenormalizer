# Terms of Service — Normalize Table

**Effective Date:** December 1, 2025

## 1. Acceptance
By installing and using the "Normalize Table" extension (hereinafter, the "Extension"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Extension.

## 2. Scope of Service
The Extension transforms pivot tables into normalized tables within Google Sheets to facilitate data analysis and manipulation. The functionality operates on the documents and permissions you authorize in your Google account.

## 3. Access and Permissions
To function, the Extension requires minimal permissions on your Sheets (for example: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` and/or `drive.file`). You must review and confirm these permissions at the time of installation.

## 4. License Agreement
You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Extension in accordance with these Terms and applicable law. You do not acquire any ownership rights to the code or content of the Extension.

## 5. Restrictions on Use
You may not: (a) copy, modify, or distribute the Extension without express authorization; (b) reverse engineer it to reproduce it; (c) use the Extension for illegal activities or activities that infringe the rights of third parties.

## 6. User Content
You are responsible for the content of the spreadsheets you process with the Extension. Ensure you have the necessary rights to process personal or sensitive data in accordance with applicable regulations.

## 7. Privacy
Data processing is described in `PRIVACY.md`. By default, processing is performed on your Google Sheets; data is not shared or sold except as specified in the Privacy Policy.

## 8. Payment and Features
The Extension is currently free. Any paid features, subscriptions, or trials will be subject to additional terms that will be clearly communicated.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the extent permitted by law, neither the developer nor contributors will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of, or inability to use, the Extension. Total liability to you will be limited to the amount received directly (if any) from the Extension in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 10. Warranties
The Extension is provided "as is" and without any express or implied warranties. We do not guarantee that the Extension will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

## 11. Termination
We may suspend or discontinue the Extension at any time. You may also revoke permissions or uninstall it from your Google account. Sections that by their nature must survive termination (e.g., limitation of liability) will survive termination.

## 12. Changes to the Terms
We may update these Terms at any time. We will publish the revised version and its effective date. If the changes are material, we will attempt to notify you through the plugin's information page or other available channels.

## 13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of the developer's country. Any dispute will be submitted to the competent courts of that jurisdiction, unless another dispute resolution mechanism is agreed upon.

## 14. Contact
