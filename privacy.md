# Privacy Policy — Normalize Table

## 1. Introduction
Normalize Table is a Google Sheets extension that transforms pivot tables into normalized tables to facilitate analysis. This policy explains what data is used and how we protect it.

## 2. Information We Collect
- Content of the spreadsheets the user selects for processing (cells, rows, columns, and metadata necessary for normalization).

- Document metadata (name and ID) only if the extension requires it.

- Anonymous and aggregated usage data **only if** the user agrees to send telemetry.

- Contact information that you voluntarily provide when requesting support.

## 3. Use of Data
- To perform the main function: reading and transforming tables within the sheets you authorize.

- To improve the extension through anonymous statistics (if enabled).

- To respond to inquiries or provide technical support.

## 4. Storage and Transfer
- Processing is performed on the data in your Google Sheets account according to the permissions you grant.

- We do not store or share your data outside your account, unless you explicitly enable features that require sending data to external servers (in which case the provider will be informed and detailed).

- We do not sell or rent your data.

## 5. Google Permissions
The extension requests the minimum necessary permissions (for example, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` and/or `drive.file`) to read and modify the sheets you authorize. Review the permissions before installing.

## 6. Security
We implement reasonable measures to protect information (secure transmission, access control). Please note that no internet transmission is 100% secure; avoid including extremely sensitive data when not necessary.

## 7. User Rights and Control
- You can revoke permissions from your Google account at any time.

- If you sent us data for support and want us to delete it, please contact us (see below).

## 8. Contact
- Email: `soporte@example.com`.

- Please indicate in the subject line: “Privacy — Normalize Table”.

## 9. Acceptance
By installing and using Normalize Table, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
